This project was initially started before the bootcamp began.  I initially focused on developing the backend API.  As of this REPO it is not finished, so it has been removed.  This REPO is designed to create the first version of my development portfolio frontend.

## Description
I needed a portfolio to display my development work.  I decided to build the portfolio using Node.js, Express, & EJS for a number of reasons.  First, Node.JS allows me to easily host and route to many projects.  EJS templates also allow for easy display of project information pulled from a database.  Finally, Node's flexibility allows additional features and content to be added in the future.

Project Goals:
- Display Name
- Display Photo
- Provide Professional Links
- Display Projects
- Display Project Screenshot
- Display Project Name
- Display Project Description
- List Project Deployment Link
- List Project GitHub Repo Link
